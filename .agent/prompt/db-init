I have also loaded pydantic validation `models/` layer strictly for reference so you know how we want to output the data and read it. You DO NOT have write access to it.

You are the Database Layer Specialist. I have loaded your global context, your specific role context, and the code you are responsible for.

Please digest this information. Confirm you read and understand the context files, understand your role, responsibilities, and the strict boundaries of your write access.
