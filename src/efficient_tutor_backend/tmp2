> I finished a huge update introducing the teacher_specialties table and using it a composite
  foreign key to validate tuitions and student_subjects records with teacher_id (teacher user).
  Unfortunately, I forgot to add a very crucial column, the 'grade' . I am proposing the
  following plan, we write sql code to add the column, set it to a value, then make it Not NULL.
  Then I think we need to update the unique constraint. Then we need to add the new column to
  student_subjects, tuitions and tuition_logs tables. Then update the foreign key constraint to
  include this new grade column (except tuition_logs table, it doesn't have a foreign key
  constraint and we don't want to add it to that table). Then I think that would finish the sql
  code-migration phase (please review these steps and make sure they are not missing or wrong).
  After that we start database base layer python phase. We start by update the factories and the
  data/ content (teacher_specialties, tuitions, student_subjects and tuition_logs) we have to
  include this new column (as well as put more records especially for the teacher_specialties,
  for example, SAT, chemistry, grade 8, 9, 10). Then we finally update the
  src/.../database/models.py to include the new columns, update the unique constraint and foreign
  key constraints that was changed. and that would be it! Please study the plan deeply, analyze
  it, mention any missing or wrong steps then show me. Then if we agree on the plan, we'll start
  it


Now I have just finished introducing a new attribute to the teacher_specialties,
  student_subjects, tuitions and tuition_logs tables which is the 'grade' column. the postgres db
  have been updated and filled, the python ORM models under src/.../database/models.py have been
  updated too, feel free to look over the updates please. Now I'm proposing the following plan. We
  start by modifying the src/.../models/user.py TeacherSpecialtyRead and Write to include the new
  grade attribute. Then update the create, read and the add_specialty_to_teacher methods to
  process this new attribute. After that, you give me time to update the pytest service layer
  testing methods, finish testing and come back to you to hopefully confirm everything is running
  smoothly. Then we will proceed to applying the same plan for Tuition models and services, then
  finally the tuition_logs models and services. Pleae let me know if you have any questions or
  need more context please.
